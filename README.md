# EncoreLink

## Purpose
We are creating an Android application for the [EncoreLink](https://github.com/codefordenver/encorelink) project. The EncoreLink project is designed to connect musicians with venues that need volunteers for events at venues such as hospitals, schools, and retirement communities.

## Setup

1. Fork the `abw1914/EncoreLink` into your own GitHub account following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

1. Create a copy of EncoreLink on your development machine (with git presumably installed already.) Replace ### with your github username

        git clone https://github.com/###/EncoreLink.git

        git remote add upstream https://github.com/abw1914/EncoreLink.git
